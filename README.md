# GraphDoc
Draw graphs of stored procedure calls and object usage.


## Prerequisites
Some use of the string_split() t-sql command in the dependency table generator so your database needs 
a minimum compatibility level 130 (i.e. SQL Server 2016 or higher).

You will need to have [GraphViz](https://www.graphviz.org) installed to render the diagrams.
